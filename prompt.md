I need help creating a 2-minute oral presentation in B1-level French titled
"Nice Ã  mille facettes". The goal is to make a high-quality, well-structured
speech that is clear, formal, and easy to memorize, in order to earn a good
grade. Focus on three important areas of content. Firstly, give me bullet points
that are easy to memorize. Then give me a full example speech. Both should use
vocabulary on B1 level or lower. The grammar should also be B1 level but with a
focus on regular forms to help avoid mistakes. Highlight important keywords to
help memorization, but don't overdo it.
